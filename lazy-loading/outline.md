# Lazy loading outline

## Intro
* What lazy loading is.
* What we'll cover: lazyloading images, lazyloading main content, infinite scrolling

## Lazyloading images
* Why lazyloading images is such a great & easy performance win

## Lazyloading main content
* Why is important: can identify content we know users engage with first, in this case a header menu, load that first, defer everything else
* DEMO: Load menu and hero, lazyload product recommendations

## Infinite scrolling (if we have time)

* Infinite scrolling is held out often as a separate thing, but it's really just lazyloading of a different kind
* We're going to combine our techniques for loading images on scroll, and ancillary content on load. We're going to ajax in content on scroll.
