Hi I'm Eli Fitch, 

Comprehensive overview of everything you need to know to make your site or app faster.

Performance is important

Videos are short

Performance is overwhelming and deep, so these quick short videos are no bullshit and give you exactly what you need and no more than that







1. Course Introduction - This movie is very important and should be the LAST to be recorded.
The video will address the following points/questions:
○ What is the subject of the course?
○ Who is the course for?
○ What prior knowledge/experience is required/assumed for people taking this course?
○ What people will learn and be able to do by taking this course?
○ What topics will be covered and how will it be presented to them?

2. About the Author - Here we’d like an outline of your skills and experience that make you an
expert in the course you’re teaching. The video should include:
○ One or two PPT slides highlighting your experience
○ A picture of you
○ The URL of your personal website or blog
○ A method of contacting you (to ask questions or for clarifications). You may want to
set up an alternate email address from your main one, such as a Gmail address for
this purpose.

3. Wrap up/ Conclusion - This movie briefly summarizes what was learned and gives you the
opportunity to thank the customer for watching the course. The video should explain the
next steps along with other resources for information in this topic area.
