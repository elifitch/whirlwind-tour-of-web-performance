# Animation Performance

## Intro
* Reiterate that the topic of animation performance could cover a whole video course all on its own, this is the barest of essentials.
* What we're covering
    - Basic overview of render pipeline
    - CSS wise, why focus only on transform and opacity
    - How to test animation performance
    - walk through diagnosing poor animation performance and cleaning it up

## Browser rendering
* Layout paint composite
* SLIDE: do one that's like layout -> paint -> composite
* SLIDE: do 3 one for each step, with bullet points and image of each


When testing off canvas, show how this anim looks fine, until u go into the performance tab and slow down the CPU then it goes to shit. the translate anim stays fine. Degrading cpu can be a good test of how your shit will look on older machines, mobile devices
