Hey there, and welcome to this course on web performance.  Web performance is critical because not everyone has access to blazing fast internet, and unlimited data plans. The web is wonderful because it's free and open for everyone. It's our responsibility as web developers to hold up our end of that promise, and that means that making sure our sites are fast and usable for everyone, regardless of their connection speed or data limits.

Web performance is a staggerlingly, intimidatingly dense topic, and can be a slog for even experienced developers to come to grips with.  That's why this course is cut up into a number of short videos, each diving into a piece of the web performance puzzle, and focusing on communicating on the bare essentials you need to get up to on each topic.  You'll also get an advanced overview of the various performance tools in chrome devtools.  You'll learn how to use devtools to measure time to first paint and time to first interactivity, throttle CPU speed to debug animations, and create shareable lighthouse performance profiles, among many other tricks of the trade.

I'm assuming familiarity with HTML, CSS, and basic ES6 javascript.  This course would be perfect for someone with broad interest on improving their webperf chops, but it could also be very useful for more experienced developers curious about a particular aspect of web performance such as animation or font loading.
