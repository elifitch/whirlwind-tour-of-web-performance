And that about wraps up the course!

Thanks very much for sticking with it until the end, I really appreciate the time you've put in, and I hope you've enjoyed the series.

We've covered a lot of ground in a short amount of time, and it's okay to feel a little overwhelmed by the different options at your disposal.  When applying your learnings to real world situations, remember to start with areas where you can get the greatest returns.  If your production code isn't minified and gzipped, that should be your first stop.  Site has a lot of images?  Make sure they're well optimized.  Seems like your site has slow time to first paint despite relatively small asset sizes?  Look at improving your webfont loading and looking after the critical rendering path.  However you decide to approach improving the speed of your site or app, remember to test and measure your results as we did throughout the course, to make sure you are moving the needle in the right direction and putting your own time to good use.

After this course you should have some very widely applicable bedrock skills that are useful in improving the performance of just about any project, and you'll start to feel more and more comfortable as you put what you've learned into practice.  Once you start running into diminishing returns using just the techniques in this course, you take your webperf skills to the next level by branching out into implementing service workers to granularly manage how you cache and request resources, web workers to move CPU intensive tasks off the render thread, and various perceived performance tricks to make your site feel faster than it is in reality.  There's a whole world of possibilities out there to make our sites and apps better, faster, and more usable for everyone regardless of their connection speed.

Want to keep up to date on developments in webperf land? The sites perfplanet.com, perf.rocks, and the performance categories of smashing magazine and CSS tricks are great places to stay up to date on the field.  And of course you can always hit me up with any questions on twitter, my handle is @elifitch, or via email at efitch.webperf@gmail.com, and I'll be more than happy to help.  Thanks again for watching the course, and you stay curious out there.
