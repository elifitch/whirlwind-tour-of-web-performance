I'm Eli Fitch, a senior web application engineer at Mapbox, where I focus on building creative tools for designing beautiful maps.  I believe that making sites as fast and lightweight as possible is a core responsibility of web developers everywhere, and I've been borderline obsessed with webperf for most of my career.  Performance has been a core component of sites and apps I've built on both product teams and at agencies for the past 5 years or so, and I've been speaking at conferences on web performance topics the last three years.

You can find a bit of my work at eli.wtf, and check out my 3d animations and experiments at codepen.io slash elifitch.  If you have any questions throughout the course, please don't hesitate to contact me on twitter, where my handle is at elifitch, or you can send me an email at efitch.webperf@gmail.com.
